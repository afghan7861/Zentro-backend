Focus on realistic, practical, encouraging advice. Split into 3 sections:

2. **Action Plan** - Provide daily or weekly steps for 1â€“3 months, broken down into specific, actionable tasks
3. **Motivational Message** - End with an encouraging, personalized message

Be encouraging, not overwhelming. Keep tone human, easy to follow, and personalized to their situation.`

  - Keep the same structure but make it flow better for audio
  - Add encouraging transitions between sections
